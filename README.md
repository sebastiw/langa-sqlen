# LangaSQL

## Building & Running

It should be as simple as `make`.  It builds and starts the postgres
database in a docker container.  Then it builds the Elixir
application, and migrates the schemas, and then starts.

You can now visit http://localhost:4000/graphiql
or post graphql querys via curl:

    $ curl 'http://localhost:4000/' -H 'content-type: application/json' -d @- <<EOF
    heredoc>  {"query": "query { users { id } }"}
    heredoc>EOF
    {"data":{"users":[{"id":"1"},{"id":"2"},{"id":"3"}]}}

## Schemas

Schemas and migrations are stored in `priv/repo/migrations/` and seeds
(test data) in `priv/repo/seeds.exs`.

To connect to the database use `make postgres-connect` after starting the db.

## Queries

GraphQL queries are used when you want to fetch data.

The structure of GraphQL requests starts with the type which of the
request, in this case a `query` and then what to query, for instance
getting all the `users`. Then GraphQL need to know which fields you
are interested in. In this example we are interested in the display
names of the users.

```
query {
  users {
    display_name
  }
}
```

Observe that it is possible to use both snake_case as well as
camelCase.

If we want sub objects of the users we can just add them to the query as follows.

```
query {
  users {
    displayName,
    tags {
      tag,
      properties {
        id,
        label,
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will return all properties tied to all tags for all users.
Example:

```
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "displayName": "Bradly Beer",
        "tags": [
          {
            "properties": [
              {
                "label": "Company name",
                "value": "Goldner-Herman"
              },
              {
                "label": "Home address",
                "value": "270 Stefanie Summit"
              }
            ],
            "tag": "Home"
          },
          {
            "properties": [
              {
                "label": "Company name",
                "value": "Goldner-Herman"
              },
              {
                "label": "Work phone",
                "value": "07618 548784"
              }
            ],
            "tag": "Work"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "displayName": "Melissa Bartell",
        "tags": [
          {
            "properties": [
              {
                "label": "Company name",
                "value": "Balistreri Inc"
              },
              {
                "label": "Home address",
                "value": "3 Lottie Mission"
              }
            ],
            "tag": "Home"
          },
          {
            "properties": [
              {
                "label": "Company name",
                "value": "Balistreri Inc"
              },
              {
                "label": "Work phone",
                "value": "+447571 806347"
              }
            ],
            "tag": "Work"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "displayName": "Ms. Joseph Moen",
        "tags": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you are only interested in one user you can filter by `id`.

```
query {
  user(id: "2") {
     displayName
  }
}
```

You can also use parameters for your requests

```
query my_user_q($my_id: ID!) {
  user(id: $my_id) {
    displayName
  }
}
```
Then send the `my_id` value as a parameter object

```
{"my_id": 2}
```

In curl the data json looks like:

```
{"query": "query my_user_q($my_id: ID!) { user(id: $my_id) { displayName } }",
 "variables": "{\"my_id\": 2}"
}
```

## Mutations

Mutations are used when you want to change the data. Example mutations
are create and delete. You also need to specify some fields for the
resulting object. In this case we only care for which `id` is created.

```
mutation {
  create_user(displayName: "Seba") {
    id
  }
}
```

```
mutation {
  delete_user(id: 4) {
    displayName
  }
}
```

For updating object, you also need specify the `etag` for the
object. Etag is the hash of some parts of the object. This is useful
when there are multiple requests coming in to make sure that the user
tries to update the object he or she wants to update.

Example. Imagine the following query and object

```
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    id, displayName, etag
  }
}
```

```
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "displayName": "Abdiel Bogan",
      "etag": "8DFD7383AB3E6F61BAF04773E551B886E453DE8604CDC2C19B2DF7A42609BDF5",
      "id": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

If the user tries to update the `displayName` to "Greta Garbo" without
the etag, but because of (for instance) network problems the query
does not go through instantaniously. The user then tries with another
name "HÃ¥kan Hemlin" instead. Both queries then go through, but because
it's the Internet the queries might come over different routes and
thus in different order. It is then impossible to say what the users
intent was. With etags you make sure that the object we are trying to
update is the object saved in the database.

```
mutation {
  update_user(id: "2", displayName: "Greta Garbo", etag: "8DFD7383AB3E6F61BAF04773E551B886E453DE8604CDC2C19B2DF7A42609BDF5") {
    id, etag, displayName
  }
}
```


## Subscriptions

Currently not supported within this project.

GraphQLs subscription API is used when a service wants to subscribe
for data changes on objects.
